ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AmerSikira

Iâ€™ve been interested in programming since I was a child. My first steps in programming were "hacking" the game called The King of the Road. Don't blame me, I needed more money to buy that truck ðŸ˜…

I have worked on many interesting projects in my professional career. Here are some of the things I did:

- created CMSs from scratch for different clients
- created several different CRMs
- several different mobile apps
- built Storage management system, also from scratch
- created a software for banks that handles certain types of documents between several different administration types
- attendance software

If you have any questions you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amer-sikira/)
